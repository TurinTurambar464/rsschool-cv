                <p>
                    My name is Dzianis. I'm 29 years old and by now I know for sure what I want to achieve in my life.
                    My purpose is to become a real professional in Web-programming.
                    I don't have any core IT-education but I'm sure that it's a feature, not a bug.
                    I'm an engineer and repairman in the past and I have a good
                    variety of experience.
                    My soft skills are good and I have broad-based knowledge.
                    The learning prospects in my past career were not really good.
                    I learned all I needed there in a year.
                    The possibility to learn is actually the main advantage of any IT-career.
                    I like to learn and do it fast so I learn Java Script with pleasure.
                    And I'll do my best to improve my technical skills and be up to the job perfectly well.
